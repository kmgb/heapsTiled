# About

A simple lib to import Tiled maps to Heaps projects. It only supports basic stuff, and it's not meant to support 100% of all Tiled features. You can extend it quite easily :)

Note: Needs to be used with [Heaps](https://heaps.io)

# Usage

Clone to your machine, then run the following to register it as a library with haxelib:
```
haxelib dev heapsTiled ./relative/path/to/cloned/heapsTiled
```

# To do list
* Support maps that use an image directly as a tilemap (you must first turn it into a tsx file then import it)
* Add more items to this list :)
